Description: library for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic (Python3)
 Mpmath is a pure-Python library for multiprecision floating-point
 arithmetic. It provides an extensive set of transcendental functions,
 unlimited exponent sizes, complex numbers, interval arithmetic,
 numerical integration and differentiation, root-finding, linear
 algebra, and much more. Almost any calculation can be performed just
 as well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision, and in many cases mpmath
 implements asymptotically fast algorithms that scale well for
 extremely high precision work.
 .
 If available, mpmath will (optionally) use gmpy to speed up high
 precision operations. If matplotlib is available, mpmath also
 provides a convenient plotting interface.
 .
 Its features include:
 .
   * Fair performance -- typically 10-100x faster than Python's
     decimal library
   * Transcendental functions -- all functions from Python's math and
     cmath modules, plus a few more like gamma, factorial, erf
   * Complex numbers -- with support for transcendental functions
   * Directed rounding -- floor, ceiling, down, up, half-down,
     half-up, half-even
   * Unlimited exponents -- no overflow or underflow
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of mpmath.
